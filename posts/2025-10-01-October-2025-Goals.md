3. Finish writing results / discussion for miRNA-mRNA interactions for AST 2021 
4. Connect w/ Chloe re AST histology 

### Sample processing

1. Nothing that I can think of...

### Data analysis

1. PI curve analysis for existing timepoints (Sept 2023 field + TCB)
2. Calcification analysis for existing timepoints (April + Sept 2023 field + TCB)
3. Trim Mcap 2023 smRNA data and run shortstack 
4. Run shortstack for sperm smRNAs 

### Field work / travel 

1. Plan for fall 2025 HI trip 
	- Test Apex equipment 
	- Make TPC chambers 
	- Pack

## How did I do on my goals this month?

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. Results for PI TPC paper - eh kinda. Have rough outline of results 
2. Outlining potential projects - not really
3. Finish writing results / discussion for miRNA-mRNA interactions for AST 2021 - yes draft is complete! Waiting for Hollie to review 
4. Connect w/ Chloe re AST histology - nope, need to do 

### Sample processing

1. Nothing that I can think of... - woo

### Data analysis

1. PI curve analysis for existing timepoints (Sept 2023 field + TCB) - yes
2. Calcification analysis for existing timepoints (April + Sept 2023 field + TCB) - yes
3. Trim Mcap 2023 smRNA data and run shortstack - no
4. Run shortstack for sperm smRNAs - yes 

### Field work / travel
