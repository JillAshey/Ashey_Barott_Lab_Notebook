## Field collections for NSF CAREER project

This post will provide methods on field collections on Patch Reef 13 in Kāne‘ohe Bay, Hawai‘i for the NSF CAREER project in the Barott lab. Corals will be collected for physiological, histological and molecular analysis. 

### Field materials 

Collect the following materials and equipment before going into the field: 

* Bone cutters x 2
* Cable ties: small, medium, and large -order more
* Whirl paks (2 oz) x 200
* Plastic bags with hole for live frags x 120
* Charged small mouth dewar -- for phys and biopsies
* 32% PFA -- glass vial (taped inside dewar casing)
* 50 mL of 1x PBS
* Label maker + label tape 
* Epitubes ~50 -- SAFE LOCK!
* Mesh bags x 2 
* Ethanol (HIMB)
* HCl (HIMB)
* Cooler (HIMB)
* Bucket (HIMB)
* Colony map (2 pages printed on underwater paper)
* Hard copy of permit (inside dewar casing)
* Utility belts x 3
* D-clips x 8
* Camera with chargers x 2
* Color card
* Metal ruler 
* Pipets -- 1 mL and 200 uL
* Tips -- 1 box of 1 mL and 1 box of 200 uL
* Gloves x 10 pairs of small, 5 x medium
* Electrical tape x 2 rolls
* Scissors x 2
* Sharpies
* Epitube rack x 1
* Fishing line
* Freezer box for histology samples
* Reusable shopping bags for grocery

All of this will be brought to the field in action packers or in personal luggage. 

### Field prep 

Once at HIMB, prep field materials - this will include labeling tubes/bags/whirlpaks and printing labels. 

- Label one plastic bags with hole with the colony ID - live frags will go in here 
- Label whirlpaks --> biopsy, phys, TPC (if needed)
	- Label with colony ID, the date of collection, and biopsy/phys/TPC (depending on what the bag will be used for)
- Label tops of epitubes for histology with colony ID 
- Print out label tape for histology tubes with KBay | Colony ID | Date and put them on the tubes 
- Print out label tape with colony ID for coral hanging (see below) 
- Print out labels on waterproof paper for the biopsy, phys, and TPC (if needed) whirlpaks and put them in the whirlpaks. This ensures that we can still tell which sample is which if the sharpie on the whirlpak rubs off. 
- Put the plastic bags with holes in them onto a ziptie in order. These will be used for field collections. 
- Put the biopsy whirlpaks onto a ziptie in order so that the ziptie is sticking through the perforated edge. 

### Histology prep 

- Make 4% PFA using the 32% PFA. Add 6.25 mL of 32% PFA to 43.75 mL of 1x PBS to make a 50 mL 4% PFA solution. 
- Add 1 mL of 4% PFA to each labeled 1.5 mL tube for histology. 

### Field collections and photos 

Coordinate with Ford and the CRL team to schedule a day and time for someone to head out to Reef 13 for boat collections. Collections typically work best with 3 people. If there are 3 people for collections, assign people to the following roles: 

- Photo taker - this person will be in charge of locating the colonies using the map, scraping CCA off the colony tags, and taking photos. 
- Coral collector - this person will be in charge of using the bone clippers to cut fragments from the colonies. 
- Bag handler - this person will have all of the labeled bags and will be in charge of putting the collected coral fragments into the correct bags. 

If there are 2 people, divide the tasks as you see fit. 

- Have the photo taker navigate to the colony pairs using the maps. 
- Once at the colony, use the metal ruler to scrap away any CCA on the colony tag so that the number can be seen in the photo. 
- Place the ruler and color card gently on the colony and take a picture of the colony with the tag visible. 
- Remove the ruler and color card and take a picture of just the colony. 
- Using the bone cutters, clip a 3-5 cm piece for physiology (and TPC or other collections if needed) and a 1-2 cm piece for the biopsy. 
- Put the 3-5 cm pieces in the plastic bag with the hole with some seawater. Close the bag so that the pieces don't fall out. 
- Put the 1-2 cm biopsy piece in the biopsy labeled whirlpak and gently twist the bag shut. Put the whirlpak in a mesh bag.  
- Move onto the next colony and repeat. 
- Collect the temperature loggers - clip the zipties holding the loggers to the cinder blocks with the bone cutters and secure the logger in a mesh bag. 
- Periodically bring back the biopsy whirlpaks to the boat while collecting. Get on the boat with the whirlpaks, squeeze out the water from the whirlpaks, roll them up tightly and freeze them in the dewar. 

### Coral hanging and histology clipping 

- As soon as the boat has returned, immediately take the dewar with the frozen biopsies to CRL's cold room for storage. DO THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE! 
- Take the cooler with the live fragments to CRL's tanks and put them in the tanks. Do not remove frags from their labeled bags. 
- Using the labels printed earlier, tape the labels to fishing line and then tie a knot around the label so it can't slip off. 
- Using bone clippers, clip a small piece (<1 cm) from each coral fragment and put it into the 4% PFA tube. This is the histology sample! 
- Tie the fishing line with the label to each coral so that it can be identified by colony ID. 
- Tie the other end of the fishing line to a extra small zip tie 
- Put the ziptie through egg crate so the coral is hanging under the egg crate suspended in the water. 
- Insert the ziptie strap backwards through the ziptie head so that the ziptie is hanging on the egg crate but it is not locked (see picture below). 

Corals are ready to go for the rest of sampling! 

- After at least 24 hours, remove the 4% PFA in the histology tubes and replace with 1 mL of 70% ethanol.
