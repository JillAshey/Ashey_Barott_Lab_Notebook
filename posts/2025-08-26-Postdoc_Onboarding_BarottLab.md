## New postdoc onboarding in the Barott Lab at the University of Pennsylvania 

Created by Jill Ashey on 8/26/25. 

### Welcome to the Barott lab! 

The following information provides important details on the onboarding process for the Barott lab at Penn. This information should be passed along to you by [Marissa Lopez](https://www.bio.upenn.edu/people/marissa-lopez), who is the postdoc coordinator for the Department of Biology. This is not an exhaustive onboarding page but should provide guidance towards getting set up at Penn. *NOTE*: This list only contains information for postdocs who are from the United States. International postdocs may require additional onboarding steps.  

#### [PennKey](https://isc.upenn.edu/pennkey)

- [How do I do it?](https://isc.upenn.edu/resources/how-do-i-get-pennkey)

This is the first thing to do before doing everything else. You should receive an email from Workday that will prompt you to register your PennKey. If you don't receive one, you can request a PennKey setup code from the PennCard Center or contact PennKey live support (https://isc.upenn.edu/pennkey/contact). Creation of your PennKey will generate your Penn username and password that can be used to log in to Workday and other Penn related websites. 

#### [Workday](https://www.workday.upenn.edu/)

Workday is where payroll, HR, and other job-related training happens. Its also where lots of your onboarding will take place. Once you log on to Workday for the first time, the following things will be on your "to-do" list: 

- I9 form
- Veteran status ID
- Disability self ID
- Payment election
- Personal info
- Emergency contacts, etc. 

Others may be there for you to do. The I9 must be completed within the first three days of work or else you can't work (boo). The rest of the I9 has be to be completed in person (see more info below). 

#### In person I9 completion at the [Onboard@Penn center](https://www.onboard.upenn.edu/)

Once the remote I9 portion has been completed on Workday, the I9 can be completed in person at the Onboard@Penn center (located on the second floor of the Penn bookstore). You must bring documents that establish identify and employment authorization (see list of acceptable documents [here](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-acceptable-documents)). Once that's done, you can complete the rest of your workday tasks, as they will become unlocked. 

#### [Penn card](https://penncard.business-services.upenn.edu/)

Get your PennCard, which is your ID card for Penn. This can be done on the second floor of the Penn bookstore. You can walk in or make in appointment. You will need to bring one form of ID (driver's license, passport). Once you have your card, send a photo of the front and back of card to Marissa so she can give you building access. 

#### Health benefits 

Once your in-person I9 is completed, you can enroll in health benefits on Workday. See more information on postdoc benefits [here](https://www.hr.upenn.edu/PennHR/benefits-compensation/postdoctoral-researchers-and-fellows). This must be completed within the first 30 days of hiring. 

#### Learner groups 

Several learner groups need to be completed before your work in the lab can commence. These are learning modules on Workday that provide information about working safely in a lab setting at Penn. The required modules for the Barott lab are: 

- Laboratory and Biological Safety at Penn Curriculum-EHRS
- Management of Laboratory Waste - UNIV
- Biosafety Cabinet Operation - EHRS

Other modules may be requied depending on your planned work. 

#### Penn email 

Once you are in the payroll system, you can get a Penn email. Email the Biology Computing department (bio-computing@sas.upenn.edu) to request an email account. 

Once you have your Penn email account, make sure to update your email in Workday to your Penn email. 

#### Penn wifi 

To get on the Penn wifi (AirPennNet), follow the instructions [here](https://isc.upenn.edu/resources/connecting-airpennnet-and-joinnow#Behavior-and-configurations). You will need to follow the configuration instructions for your specific device. 

#### Building access 

Swipe access is required for the main entrance of Leidy. Once you have your ID card, send a photo of the front and back of card to Marissa so she can give you building access. Marissa or other Barott lab members will provide you with keys to Leidy and the lab. 
	
#### Barott lab remote data storage 

The Barott lab primarily stores data and protocols on [Box](https://www2.isc.upenn.edu/pennbox) and Benchling. Send Katie your email and ask to be added to the Barott lab groups on those platforms.
