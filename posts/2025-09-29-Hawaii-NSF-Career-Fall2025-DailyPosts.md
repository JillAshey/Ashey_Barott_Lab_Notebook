Arrived! Unpacked, got groceries. 

## 20250930

Today was mostly a prep day. In the morning, Marcelina and I labeled tubes, bags, and whirlpaks for the field. We labelled the following 

- Plastic bags for field collections 
- Whirlpaks for freezing phys samples after PI curve
- Whirlpaks for freezing TPC samples after TPCs 
- Whirlpaks for freezing biopsies on boat 
- 1.5mL tubes for histology clips 

For the phys and TPC samples, we also printed out labels on waterproof paper to stick in the whirlpaks in case the sharpie on the whirlpak comes off. For the 1.5mL tubes, we printed labels and stuck them on the side of the tubes. 

We also got out all the respiration equipment and set it up in the bat cave at CRL. We tested the light intensities to determine the PAR levels for the PI curves: 

| Intensity (%) | Light (umol/m2/s) | Light (umol/m2/s) | Light (umol/m2/s) | Light (umol/m2/s) | avg     | Light levels Jan 2025 | Light levels Sept 2024 | Light levels in May 2024 | Light levels in Jan 2024 | Sept 2023 | AVERAGE from previous runs | SD from previous runs |

We then calibrated the O2 probes on the Presens software. 

I brought the TPC chambers to the batcave as well and filled them with water to make sure they are watertight. I need to label them and reglue any that are leaking.

Marcelina, Kama, Maddie and I went to reef 13 today to collect and take pictures of the corals. Marcelina did the tag cleaning and picture taking, I did the collecting, and Kama managed the bags underwater. We also collected the temperature loggers. We collected the following: 

- Biopsies = Mcap (17) + Pcomp (18) = 35 (frozen in dewar on boat)
- Phys = Pcomp (24) + Mcap (19) = 43 
- TPC = 43 (same as phys)
- Eric = 24 Pcomp 

Overall, reef didn't look great. There were lots of patchy/bleaching Porites and Montipora. Notes on tagged colonies: 

- 219/220 are dead. Completely gone. Did not collect :( 
- 19, 3 is bleached 
- Most Pcomps look good 
- Mcaps look eh - especially the susceptible ones 
- 210 is growing into 209 space 
- 201/202 are losing mass 
- 247 and 241 show evidence of paling 
- 211 has partial mortality 

We also lost one of the temperature loggers, must have dropped it while we were collecting. 

After we got back, we put the frozen biopsies upstairs and put the corals in the CRL tanks. We then tied string around each colony with a tag and hung them from egg crate in the tanks. While we did this, we took clippings for histology, put them in 4% PFA, and stored them in the walk in fridge. 

Around 8pm, we used the mini PAM from the ToBo lab to PAM our corals. Usually, we use the CRL imaging PAM but it is currently in Europe being used or being serviced. The PAM values from the mini PAM were much higher than values that we have gotten in the past from the imaging PAM. This could be due to different settings or differences in the equipment itself. Unsure if we will use the PAM data from this timepoint.

Marcelina uploaded the photos we took yesterday to Box. Today, we did all the PI curves for the phys samples (5 rounds). 

PI curve round 1

| Light level (%) | PAR  | Time started | Mins    |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------ | ------- |
| 10              | 220  | 8:35         | 15 mins |
| 20              | 445  | 8:52         | 10 mins |
| 40              | 707  | 9:03         | 10 mins |
| 60              | 1013 | 9:15         | 10 mins |
| 80              | 1284 | 9:26         | 10 mins |
| 100             | 1570 | 9:37         | 15 mins |
| 0               | 0    | 9:54         | 15 mins |

- For Round 1, temperature probes 1 and 5 were in the incorrect locations for the first 15 mins. We switched them to the correct positions at the start of 20% light. These data (when we switched them) will need to be removed. 

PI curve round 2

| Light level (%) | PAR  | Time started | Mins    |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------ | ------- |
| 10              | 220  | 10:33        | 15 mins |
| 20              | 445  | 10:50        | 10 mins |
| 40              | 707  | 11:01        | 10 mins |
| 60              | 1013 | 11:12        | 10 mins |
| 80              | 1284 | 11:23        | 10 mins |
| 100             | 1570 | 11:34        | 15 mins |
| 0               | 0    | 11:50        | 15 mins |

PI curve round 3

| Light level (%) | PAR  | Time started | Mins    |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------ | ------- |
| 10              | 220  | 12:17        | 15 mins |
| 20              | 445  | 12:35        | 10 mins |
| 40              | 707  | 12:46        | 10 mins |
| 60              | 1013 | 12:58        | 10 mins |
| 80              | 1284 | 13:09        | 10 mins |
| 100             | 1570 | 13:20        | 15 mins |
| 0               | 0    | 13:36        | 15 mins |

- Round 3 -- During 20 - 40% light, the incoming seawater was turned off for ~20 mins while the sand filters were replaced by CRL techs. The water levels dropped quite a bit, so we brought in water from the outdoor tanks to fill the tank while the water was off. Water also probably heated up a bit during this time but won't know until we read out the hobo logger data. 

PI curve round 4

| Light level (%) | PAR  | Time started | Mins    |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------ | ------- |
| 10              | 220  | 14:06        | 15 mins |
| 20              | 445  | 14:23        | 10 mins |
| 40              | 707  | 14:34        | 10 mins |
| 60              | 1013 | 14:45        | 10 mins |
| 80              | 1284 | 14:57        | 10 mins |
| 100             | 1570 | 15:08        | 15 mins |
| 0               | 0    | 15:25        | 15 mins |

- Temp probe 4 was sticking out a little during 10% light, stuck back in all the way at start of 20% light

PI curve round 5

| Light level (%) | PAR  | Time started | Mins    |
| --------------- | ---- | ------------ | ------- |
| 10              | 220  | 15:56        | 15 mins |
| 20              | 445  | 16:12        | 10 mins |
| 40              | 707  | 16:23        | 10 mins |
| 60              | 1013 | 16:34        | 10 mins |
| 80              | 1284 | 16:46        | 10 mins |
| 100             | 1570 | 16:57        | 15 mins |
| 0               | 0    | 17:14        | 15 mins |

After PI curves were finished, I read out the pendant logger (21257935) that I had deployed for measuring the water temperature during the PI curves. I also ead out U22 loggers (21152007 and 21152009; 21152009 currently lost on reef) from reef and pendant logger (21257935) from PI curves. Will need to relaunch U22s before putting them back on reef. Would be curious to compare our U22 data to CRL data from PR13.   

I also reglued two TPC chambers that leaked during my fill test. We also played around with the best way to seal them from the top for TPC time. 

We realized that we made the 4% PFA solution with DI water instead of 1x PBS. We will need to remake the solution and reclip corals for histology. 

## 20251003

Light calcification incubations and titrations were conducted today (4 runs, 11 corals per run + 1 blank per run; 1 hr per run; light set to ~45%, about ~750 PAR). I added the pendant logger (21257935) to the runs to measure water temps during the light incubations. While I did the incubations, Marcelina titrated in the Point lab. 

I relabled histology tubes, made new 4% PFA with 1x PBS, and reclipped the TPC corals for histology. 

Sarah arrived! 

## 20251004

Dark calcification incubations and titrations were conducted today (4 runs, 11 corals per run + 1 blank per run; 1 hr per run; light set to ~45%, about ~750 PAR). I added the pendant logger (21257935) to the runs to measure water temps during the dark incubations. While I did the incubations, Marcelina and Sarah titrated in the Point lab. 

## 20251005

Today was a lot of TPC prep! I set up the Apex, the energy bar, and two PM1s. The brain and PM1s have temperature probes, which I calibrated today. Since our energy bar is from AUS, it has AUS outlets so I had to buy plug adapters from Target. I also got a cooler at Target for prepping the TPC runs. 

Sarah and Marcelina got a cardboard box at City Mill for shipping samples to Eric on Tuesday. They also bought clear command hooks to put on the chamber lids so we can take the lids off easily. Sarah glued the hooks on with acrylic glue but the glue ended up looking kinda opaque on the lids which isn't ideal...may have to re-make the lids for next time. We will see how they end up working. 

I positioned the lights over the cooler and measured the light levels but will need to re-measure with the lids on. Ideally, lights should be between 700-800 PAR. 

Sarah labeled more zubs for water collections after the TPCs. 

Sarah and Marcelina did the fraggameter on the phys frags and then froze them in the dewar. Hooray, phys is done! I also switched the histology clips from the 4% PFA to 70% ethanol. 

## 20251006

My birthday! Woo. 

Today is mostly another prep day. We checked in with CRL at their kickoff meeting where we coordinated space in the wet lab for this week and boat needs for next week. 

The digitial pipette that Marcelina usually uses for titrations isn't working (won't charge), so we are going to use one of CRLs for the TPC titrations. 

I filled 2mL tubes with 1mL of DNA/RNA shield for TPC coral clippings after the runs. We also remeasured the light levels with the lids on to get the proper light intensity. 

We filled a bucket with water and started chilling it overnight to 18C with the chiller. We also added an airstone to aerate the water. 

I also started a collections [log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yhxCiS8EuygY_HrMUdU5mH5U_ejDvqG1fHJpZ1K69F8/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to record number of fragments collected for SAP reporting. 

## 20251007

Sarah and Marcelina packed up the porites corals to ship to Eric and dropped them at the top of the hill this morning. Package picked up around 12:30pm. 

First TPC day! I am on TPCs, and Sarah and Marcelina are titrating in the point lab.

Apex disconnected from fusion at 13:39. Waiting a few mins to see if it will turn back on. Came back on after about 10 mins. Looking at Fusion, it seems like Apex went offline a few times over the past 24 hrs. Likely due to the instability of HIMB wifi. 

I need to calibrate the apex probes in the morning before runs because they are off (by a degree C or more) from the traceable temp probe. Makes it difficult to adjust the heaters in real time. 

It was hard to reach and maintain 38C - I had to add both 600W heaters and three 50W heaters to the water bath to get it to temp. 

Started chilling water with chiller + airstone at 18C for tomorrow runs at 5:45pm. I also filled up two coolers to chill at room temp for tomorrow. 

## 20251008

Calibrated apex probes before runs, but still kinda off.

Porites reached UC riverside today, waiting to hear back on their condition. 

Started chilling water with chiller + airstone at 18C for tomorrow runs at 6pm. I also filled up two coolers to chill at room temp for tomorrow.

Eric said Porites were received and are in tanks now! 

I ran the 38C ~10 mins longer today - the temp dropped a little during the run and I wasn't seeing metabolic depression yet. 

Started chilling water with chiller + airstone at 18C for tomorrow runs at 6:30pm. I also filled up two coolers to chill at room temp for tomorrow.

Issue with stir bars at beginning of 25C, had to restart run after 10 mins. 

34C - channel 8 looks very wonky, big spike up about 10 mins in, no real increase after that. This frag also looks kinda bleachy. 

Started chilling water with chiller and airstone at 18C for the LAST RUN tomorrow at 6:30pm. 

Temps can be a little all over the place for 38C, as I am trying to maintain it at 38C but can be difficult because that is so warm and none of our heaters actually reach those temperatures.

For the TPC fragments, 225 and 226 are in the wrong whirlpaks --> 225 is in 226 and vice versa. I wrote a note on the 226 whirlpak waterproof paper.  

For 38C, I didnt really see metabolic depression until about 50 mins in. Ran for an extra 15 mins. 

DONE with resp equipment! I wiped down all temp and O2 probes with ethanol and unplugged them from the presens. I also rinsed all heaters and pumps and put out to dry. 

## 20251012

Cleaned up a lot of our stuff in CRL today. We shut down and packed up the apex, packed up resp equipment and put in creepy closet, and packed up most of our gear from CRL. I mopped the floors as well, since I got them very dirty from spilling water all week. I also started running the chiller with freshwater to flush any saltwater from it. 

I exported all TPC data from presens onto Box, as well as the temp data from the pendant logger. 

I also redeployed a pendant logger for the reef since we lost one of our U22s. 

Marcelina printed out the shipping label for the dewar to ship tomorrow. We also gathered materials and prepped for the field tomorrow. 

## 20251013

CRL kickoff meeting and then photogrammatry field day with myself, Marcelina, Sarah, Kama, and Maddie. 

Marcelina and Kama did the 4 photogrammatry reef spirals while Maddie and I did the 4 benthic transects. We did forgoet our photoquad but still took pictures every 2 meters with the color card/ruler. 

Marcelina, Kama, Maddie and I did the colony level photogrammatry. Maddie and I deployed the temp loggers - the U22s are in the first channel and the pendant is at the far side of the reef. 

## 20251014

Pretty chill day! Marcelina and I led CRL journal club - we discussed Brown et al. 2023. Sarah left in the afternoon. Marcelina uploaded all photogrammatry and transect photos from yesterday to Box. We also got the chiller from the lab to pack and prepped slides for CRL lab meeting tomorrow. 

## 20251015

Another pretty chill day. We presented our ongoing work for the NSF career in CRL lab meeting today, as well as some of my previous Mcap larval work. Marcelina printed out a copy of the permit, and I packed the action packers, as well as my personal stuff. I also parafilmed the histology tubes and found a freezer box for the TPC shield tubes. 

## 20251016

Departure day! Before I left, we got the boxes with the histology and shield tubes and packed them with ice packs in the action packers. Our TPC frags didn't fit in the dewar so we are leaving them behind for the time being in CRL's freezer. Took a picture of their location and sent to Ford so he knows where they are. 

We also collected ~100 Aiptasia from CRL tanks to bring back to Penn for undergrad teaching labs. They went into 2 50mL falcon tubes with seawater and were packed in the action packer. 

## 20251017

I arrived in Philly at 5:30am. Went to lab to drop off action packers and put away samples. The histology samples went into the 4C mini-fridge upstairs. The TPC samples went into the bottom shelf of the -80C downstairs. The Aiptasia were put in a container with fresh seawater and put in the 18C incubator. The dewar was also in the downstairs lab, so I put away the biopsy and phys frags in two separate ziplock bags that are stored on the bottom shelf of the -80C.
