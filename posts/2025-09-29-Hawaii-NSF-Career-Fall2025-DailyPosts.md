Arrived! Unpacked, got groceries.

Today was mostly a prep day. In the morning, Marcelina and I labeled tubes, bags, and whirlpaks for the field. We labelled the following 

- Plastic bags for field collections 
- Whirlpaks for freezing phys samples after PI curve
- Whirlpaks for freezing TPC samples after TPCs 
- Whirlpaks for freezing biopsies on boat 
- 1.5mL tubes for histology clips 

For the phys and TPC samples, we also printed out labels on waterproof paper to stick in the whirlpaks in case the sharpie on the whirlpak comes off. For the 1.5mL tubes, we printed labels and stuck them on the side of the tubes. 

We also got out all the respiration equipment and set it up in the bat cave at CRL. We tested the light intensities to determine the PAR levels for the PI curves: 

| Intensity (%) | Light (umol/m2/s) | Light (umol/m2/s) | Light (umol/m2/s) | Light (umol/m2/s) | avg     | Light levels Jan 2025 | Light levels Sept 2024 | Light levels in May 2024 | Light levels in Jan 2024 | Sept 2023 | AVERAGE from previous runs | SD from previous runs |

We then calibrated the O2 probes on the Presens software. 

I brought the TPC chambers to the batcave as well and filled them with water to make sure they are watertight. I need to label them and reglue any that are leaking.

Marcelina, Kama, Maddie and I went to reef 13 today to collect and take pictures of the corals. Marcelina did the tag cleaning and picture taking, I did the collecting, and Kama managed the bags underwater. We also collected the temperature loggers. We collected the following: 

- Biopsies = Mcap (17) + Pcomp (18) = 35 (frozen in dewar on boat)
- Phys = Pcomp (24) + Mcap (19) = 43 
- TPC = 43 (same as phys)
- Eric = 24 Pcomp 

Overall, reef didn't look great. There were lots of patchy/bleaching Porites and Montipora. Notes on tagged colonies: 

- 219/220 are dead. Completely gone. Did not collect :( 
- 19, 3 is bleached 
- Most Pcomps look good 
- Mcaps look eh - especially the susceptible ones 
- 210 is growing into 209 space 
- 201/202 are losing mass 
- 247 and 241 show evidence of paling 
- 211 has partial mortality 

We also lost one of the temperature loggers, must have dropped it while we were collecting. 

After we got back, we put the frozen biopsies upstairs and put the corals in the CRL tanks. We then tied string around each colony with a tag and hung them from egg crate in the tanks. While we did this, we took clippings for histology, put them in 4% PFA, and stored them in the walk in fridge. 

Around 8pm, we used the mini PAM from the ToBo lab to PAM our corals. Usually, we use the CRL imaging PAM but it is currently in Europe being used or being serviced. The PAM values from the mini PAM were much higher than values that we have gotten in the past from the imaging PAM. This could be due to different settings or differences in the equipment itself. Unsure if we will use the PAM data from this timepoint.

Marcelina uploaded the photos we took yesterday to Box. Today, we did all the PI curves for the phys samples (5 rounds). 

Notes on PI curves: 

- For Round 1, temperature probes 1 and 5 were in the incorrect locations for the first 15 mins. We switched them to the correct positions at the start of 20% light. These data (when we switched them) will need to be removed. 
- Round 3 -- During 20 - 40% light, the incoming seawater was turned off for ~20 mins while the sand filters were replaced by CRL techs. The water levels dropped quite a bit, so we brought in water from the outdoor tanks to fill the tank while the water was off. Water also probably heated up a bit during this time but won't know until we read out the hobo logger data. 
- Temp probe 4 was sticking out a little during 10% light, stuck back in all the way at start of 20% light

After PI curves were finished, I read out the pendant logger (21257935) that I had deployed for measuring the water temperature during the PI curves. 

I also reglued two TPC chambers that leaked during my fill test. We also played around with the best way to seal them from the top for TPC time. 

We realized that we made the 4% PFA solution with DI water instead of 1x PBS. We will need to remake the solution and reclip corals for histology.

Light calcification incubations and titrations were conducted today (4 runs, 11 corals per run + 1 blank per run; 1 hr per run; light set to ~45%, about ~750 PAR). I added the pendant logger (21257935) to the runs to measure water temps during the light incubations. While I did the incubations, Marcelina titrated in the Point lab. 

I relabled histology tubes, made new 4% PFA with 1x PBS, and reclipped the TPC corals for histology. 

Sarah arrived!

Dark calcification incubations and titrations were conducted today (4 runs, 11 corals per run + 1 blank per run; 1 hr per run; light set to ~45%, about ~750 PAR). I added the pendant logger (21257935) to the runs to measure water temps during the dark incubations. While I did the incubations, Marcelina and Sarah titrated in the Point lab.

Today was a lot of TPC prep! I set up the Apex, the energy bar, and two PM1s. The brain and PM1s have temperature probes, which I calibrated today. Since our energy bar is from AUS, it has AUS outlets so I had to buy plug adapters from Target. I also got a cooler at Target for prepping the TPC runs. 

Sarah and Marcelina got a cardboard box at City Mill for shipping samples to Eric on Tuesday. They also bought clear command hooks to put on the chamber lids so we can take the lids off easily. Sarah glued the hooks on with acrylic glue but the glue ended up looking kinda opaque on the lids which isn't ideal...may have to re-make the lids for next time. We will see how they end up working. 

I positioned the lights over the cooler and measured the light levels but will need to re-measure with the lids on. Ideally, lights should be between 700-800 PAR. 

Sarah labeled more zubs for water collections after the TPCs. 

Sarah and Marcelina did the fraggameter on the phys frags and then froze them in the dewar. Hooray, phys is done! I also switched the histology clips from the 4% PFA to 70% ethanol.

My birthday! Woo. 

Today is mostly another prep day. We checked in with CRL at their kickoff meeting where we coordinated space in the wet lab for this week and boat needs for next week. 

The digitial pipette that Marcelina usually uses for titrations isn't working (won't charge), so we are going to use one of CRLs for the TPC titrations.
