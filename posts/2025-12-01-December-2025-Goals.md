December 2025 goals and daily notebook entries.

## Goals

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. Results for cnidarian sperm smRNA
2. Connect w/ Chloe re AST histology paper 
3. Update results for PI TPC paper 
4. Submit AST 2021 to journal and biorxiv

### Sample processing

1. Continue processing NSF CAREER phys samples - airbrushing, guava, etc 

### Data analysis

1. Cnidarian sperm miRNA enrichment + homology of targets 
2. Trim Mcap 2023 smRNA data and run shortstack 
3. Ptua assembly QC and start annotation 
4. Any e5 stuff

## How did I do on my goals this month?

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. Results for cnidarian sperm smRNA - kinda sorta. I want to talk to Nick more about the sequence distribution plots. 
2. Connect w/ Chloe re AST histology paper - nope.
3. Update results for PI TPC paper - nope.
4. Submit AST 2021 to journal and biorxiv - nope! Hollie read intro and methods and said I need to include network analysis so that sets me back quite a bit. 

### Sample processing

1. Continue processing NSF CAREER phys samples - airbrushing, guava, etc - yes, completed lots of AFDW. 

### Data analysis

1. Cnidarian sperm miRNA enrichment + homology of targets - yes. 
2. Trim Mcap 2023 smRNA data and run shortstack - nope
3. Ptua assembly QC and start annotation - yes, assembly is very fragmented. Need to discuss w/ Hollie before moving forward. Could try other assemblers but it may be a sample issue idk.
4. Any e5 stuff - resubmitted e5 ncRNA paper to Environmental Epigenetics 

### Field work / travel 

1. Planning for HI Jan trip - yes, confirmed dates w/ Ford. Booked housing/flights and submitted visitor form. 

Goodbye 2025! So much to do in 2026.
