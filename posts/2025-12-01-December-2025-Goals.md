December 2025 goals and daily notebook entries.

## Goals

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. Results for cnidarian sperm smRNA
2. Connect w/ Chloe re AST histology paper 
3. Update results for PI TPC paper 
4. Submit AST 2021 to journal and biorxiv

### Sample processing

1. Continue processing NSF CAREER phys samples - airbrushing, guava, etc 

### Data analysis

1. Cnidarian sperm miRNA enrichment + homology of targets 
2. Trim Mcap 2023 smRNA data and run shortstack 
3. Ptua assembly QC and start annotation 
4. Any e5 stuff
