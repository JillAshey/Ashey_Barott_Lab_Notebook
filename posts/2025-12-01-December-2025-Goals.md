December 2025 goals and daily notebook entries.

## Goals

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. Results for cnidarian sperm smRNA
2. Connect w/ Chloe re AST histology paper 
3. Update results for PI TPC paper 
4. Submit AST 2021 to journal and biorxiv

### Sample processing

1. Continue processing NSF CAREER phys samples - airbrushing, guava, etc 

### Data analysis

1. Cnidarian sperm miRNA enrichment + homology of targets 
2. Trim Mcap 2023 smRNA data and run shortstack 
3. Ptua assembly QC and start annotation 
4. Any e5 stuff

### Field work / travel 

1. Planning for HI Jan trip 

### 20251201

- Started running hifiasm on Ptua genome 
- Writing methods for cnidarian sperm paper 
- piRNA homology enrichment for sperm

### 20251202

- Ptua genome assembly QC + assembly iterations 
- Labelling tubes for airbrushing 
- Retrimming sperm data 

### 20251203

- Rerunning shortstack on sperm samples (newly trimmed w/ trimmomatic)
- Airbrushing + guava 12 samples 
- Sent Nvec samples 
- Started hifiasm iterations 
- Enrichment of shared piRNA gene overlaps + species specific 

### 20251204

- Airbrushing + guava 12 samples 
- Ahya 3UTR target analysis 
- Homology for miRNAs 
- Ptua assembly QC 





to do

- move ptua stuff to scratch workspace 
- remind hollie to read AST 2021 
- homology stuff for sperm -- functional 
- tRNA analysis for sperm -- email nick for scripts 
- make metadata sheets for phys data 
- post translator reef bite articles 








to do 

- sign up for BIO-WHP speaking slot 
- pay women's and infant health charge 
- ask marissa about postdoc travel $$
