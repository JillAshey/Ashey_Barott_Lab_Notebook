## How did I do with my goals this month? 

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. Results for PI TPC paper - yes, for all results that we have so far. 
2. Outlining potential projects - not really
3. Finish writing results / discussion for miRNA-mRNA interactions for AST 2021 - yes full draft complete! 
4. Connect w/ Chloe re AST histology - no, will connect after I get back from the field

### Sample processing

1. Nothing that I can think of...

### Data analysis

1. PI curve analysis for existing timepoints (Sept 2023 field + TCB) - yes
2. Calcification analysis for existing timepoints (April + Sept 2023 field + TCB) - yes
3. Trim Mcap 2023 smRNA data and run shortstack - no
4. Run shortstack for sperm smRNAs - yes, running into some issues with not identifying many miRNAs in sperm smRNA data. This could be biologically accurate or some artifact of the extraction/library prep methods. I want to extract/prep/sequence adult AST and Nemastostella with these methods to ground truth 

### Field work / travel 

1. Plan for fall 2025 HI trip -- currently in the field 
	- Test Apex equipment - yes
	- Make TPC chambers - yes
	- Pack - yes
