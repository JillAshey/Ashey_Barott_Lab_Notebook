## Airbrushing KBay samples 

These protocols were primarily developed by Kristin Brown, Marcelina Martynek, and other members of the Barott lab. This post will contain details on airbrushing the KBay samples for the NSF CAREER project. 

### Materials needed 

- Airbrush and air compressor 
- Small ziplock bags 
- Ice + ice bucket 
- 1x PBS
- 0.1% SDS in FSW
- Small and large benchtop centrifuges 
- Flat-bottom 96-well plate 
- 3x 1.5 mL tubes (AFDW, protein/MAAs, sym counts)
- 2x 50 mL tubes (airbrushing/centrifugation, storage)
- 1x 15 mL tube (chlorophyll)
- 3x 1.5 mL tubes for Guava prep 
- Pipettes + tips (p1000, p200, serological)
- Freezer boxes for 1.5 mL tubes

### Sample and materials prep 

- Label sample tubes with sample info 
	- For the KBay samples, I'm going to label them with the sample number, the time point (May '24, etc), KBAY, my initials, and date of airbrushing.
	- This can be done the day before.
- Prep 1x PBS 
	- We have 10x PBS as a liquid. Calculate how much PBS is needed and how much needs to be made. This can be done the day before.  
	- For example, if a liter of 1x PBS is needed, mix 900 mL DI water and 100 mL of 10x PBS for 1 liter of 1x PBS. 
- Prep 0.1% SDS in FSW
	- We have dry SDS micropellets. To make a 1 L solution of 0.1% SDS in FSW, weigh out 1 gram of SDS pellets and add to 1 L of FSW. Put a stir bar in the container and put container on stir plate to mix until pellets have dissolved. 
	- This can be done the day before. 
- Take out samples and put on ice to defrost a little before airbrushing. 
- Turn centrifuges on and set to 4°C. 
- Fill one set of 50 mL tubes with 50 mL of 1x PBS. 

### Airbrushing & homogenization

- Set up compressor in fume hood. 
- Take a sample off ice and place in a small ziplock bag. 
- Attach the 50 mL tube filled with 1x PBS to the airbrush 
- Spray the coral fragment until all tissue is off of the skeleton. This may take some time (~10 mins). 
	- Be careful not to spill or spray excessively. 
- Once tissue is off, continue spraying until all PBS from the tube is used. 
- Remove the 50 mL tube from the airbrush and pour the tissue slurry into that tube. 
- Note volume in tube in notebook. 
- Place 50 mL tube on ice or in large centrifuge to keep cold. 
- Put skeleton on a tray with whirlpak to dry. 
- Move onto the next sample. 
- Once all samples are done, homogenize the sample with the homogenizer at highest speed for 15-20 seconds. 
	- Rinse homogenizer with DI water in between samples. 

### Host/sym separation and aliquoting 

- Centrifuge the slurry for 5 mins at 4°C at 4000 rpm in the large centrifuge. 
- Transfer 1 mL of supernatent (host fraction) to the ADFW and protein 1.5 mL tubes.
- Transfer the remaining supernatent into the other 50 mL tube for storage. This can be used for later host assays. 
	- If the pellet (symbiont fraction) becomes disturbed when transferring supernatent, re-centrifuge. 
- Move the 50 mL tubes with the host fraction into the -80C freezer for storage. 
- Resuspend the symbiont pellet with 10 mL of 1x PBS. 
- Vortex to mix. 
- Transfer 1 mL of symbiont fraction into the symbiont 1.5 mL tubes. This is for symbiont counting! 
- Transfer the remaining symbiont fraction (~9 mL) into the labelled 15 mL tube. 
	- The 50 mL tube can now be discarded. 
- Centrifuge the 15 mL tube for 5 mins at 4°C at 4000 rpm in the large centrifuge. 
- Discard liquid and freeze pellet in -80C until processing. This is for chlorophyll! 

### Guava sample prep 

- Centrifuge the 1.5 mL tube with the symbiont fraction at 4°C, 7000 rpm, 5 min. 
- Remove supernatent from symbiont tube, leaving the pellet. 
- Add 900 uL of SDS to the pellet - this is our 1:1 dilution. 
- Homogenize to break up chunks. 
	- It may get 'soapy' or spill over the tube when homogenizing. 
- In a new 1.5 mL tube, add 300 uL of the 1:1 dilution and 600 uL of SDS - this is our 1:3 dilution. 
- In a new 1.5 mL tube, add 300 uL of the 1:3 dilution and 600 uL of SDS - this is our 1:9 dilution. 
- Pipette 150 uL triplicates of the 1:3 and 1:9 dilution into a 96-well flat bottom plate. 
	- Briefly vortex tubes before pipetting samples into plate. 
- Take to Guava for counting!
