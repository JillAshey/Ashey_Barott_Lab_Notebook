## Nematostella spawning and larval rearing 

These protocols were primarily developed by Ben Glass and other members of the Barott lab. 

Nematostella spawning happens every two weeks in the lab. In fall 2025, we will be collecting different developmental stages of Nematostella to send to collaborators at UPitt. This post will detail the spawning prep, spawning, egg/larval rearing, and collections. 

### Prep 

Make sure to label all tubes with the contents, date, and initials! 

#### Spawning prep

- Spawning must be set up at least 14 hours before the desired spawning time! Back calculate when all the work will take place to decide on set up times. 
- Put the anemones in the tubs on the top shelf under the light. 
- Set the light timer so that the anemones are exposed to light for 14 hours prior to spawning. 
- Plug the lights into the light timer outlet. 
- Use the ramp feature on the incubator to set the temperature to ramp up to 24°C and hold for 14 hours prior to spawning. 
- Turn the other incubator on and set to 25°C. 

#### Dejellying prep

Nematostella eggs come out in a jelly, which they can be fertilized in. However, if sampling needs to be done before 3 dpf (days post fertilization), the jelly should be removed. This can be done with a cysteine/NaOH/seawater solution that can be prepped days to hours before spawning. 

We have solid 98% sodium hydroxide pellets in the lab. 5M NaOH requires about 200g of pure NaOH per liter. Adjusting for 98% purity: approximately 204 g of pellets per liter. For 50 mL (0.05 L), amount of pellets needed = 204g × 0.05 = 10.2g of NaOH pellets.

- Weigh out 10.2g of 98% NaOH pellets into a 50 mL tube. 
- Dissolve the pellets in ~40 mL of DI water. The reaction is exothermic, so the solution will heat up. 
- Stir or gently mix the solution to dissolve the pellets.
- Once the solution cools, add ~10 mL of DI water to reach ~50 mL. 

To make ~50 mL of the cysteine solution: 

- Add 2g of solid cysteine to a 50 mL tube and fill tube with 50mL of filtered seawater (~12 ppt; FSW). 
- Add 10 drops of 5M NaOH with a transfer pipette to the tube. 
- Place tube on rocker until particles dissolve 

#### Collections prep

For collections, Nematostella will be fixed in 4% PFA and then rinsed with different ethanol concentrations (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) before being stored in 70% ethanol at 4°C. Prep these solutions beforehand. We have 32% PFA in the chemical cabinent below the fume hood and bottles of ethanol in the flammable cabinet below the fumehood. 

- Measure 6.25 mL of 32% PFA stock and dilute it with FSW up to a final volume of 50 mL.
- Make ethanol concentrations in 50mL tubes.
	- 25% ethanol: 12.5 mL ethanol + 37.5 mL DI water 
	- 50% ethanol: 25 mL ethanol + 25 mL DI water
	- 75% ethanol: 37.5 mL ethanol + 12.5 mL DI water
	- 100% ethanol: 50 mL ethanol, no water needed 
	- 70% ethanol: 35 mL ethanol + 15 mL DIwater (for storage)

### Spawning, dejellying, and fertilization 

- On the day of spawning, remove the anemones from the incubator and place them on bench under ambient lights
	- Some will have spawned overnight, some will take an hour or more after being removed from the incubator to spawn. 
- Move egg bundles to 15 mL tubes using transfer pipette with cut tip -- 2 mL of eggs per 15 mL tube
- To the 2 mL of eggs, add 12 mL cysteine solution (to the 14 mL mark). 
- Place tubes on the rocker for 9 minutes 
- While tubes are rocking, move spermy water into petri dishes for fertilization
- After 9 minutes, stand tubes upright and let eggs settle to the bottom (~1 min) 
- Remove water down to 2 mL with a transfer pipette or by pouring water off. Don't remove eggs!
- Replace water with fresh FSW. 
- Gently invert tube to suspend eggs.
- Repeat for a total of 4 washes, with ~1 minute in between each wash. 
- After the final wash, remove excess water and transfer eggs into the petri dishes with the sperm for fertilization.
- Move the dishes into the other incubator (which should be at 25°C) to develop. 
- Check back in a few hours to see if the embryos are cleaving and to change the water to fresh seawater. 
- To remove sperm water, collect the embryos in a separate dish or move them to the center of the dish and remove the water by sucking it up from the side of the dish. 
- Add fresh FSW from the side of the dish. 
- At the end of spawning, do water changes on all containers and feed adults, then return to incubator; note that some may spawn late.
- Unplug the lights in the incubator. 

### Larval rearing and collections

We will be collecting at the following developmental stages: 

- Blastula stages (~4-6 hpf at 25°C)
- Gastrula stage (~18 hpf at 25°C)
- Planula stage (~48 hpf at 25°C)
- Early Juvenile stage (~5 dpf at 25°C)

It's important to note that the lab is NOT at 25°C - it fluctuates between ~20-22°C, which means that the Nematostella will develop more slowly than the above times. They can be left on the lab bench to develop but it will just take more time. In this case, I'm using the other incubator set to 25°C. 

- Check developmental stage by looking at the petri dishes under the dissecting scope. Perform collections if larvae are at the desired stage. 
- For collections, use a cut transfer pipette to collect embryos/larvae and put them in a 1.5 mL tube. 
	- Let embryos/larvae sink to the bottom (~1 min) and then remove as much seawater as you can. 
	- Not sure how many embryos/larvae we will have for collections, so not sure yet how many to put in each tube. There may be multiple tubes needed per stage. 
- Add 1 mL of 4% PFA to the tubes and let them fix for one hour at room temperature. 
- After an hour, remove the PFA from the tube and add 25% ethanol for 10 mins at room temperature 
- Repeat this for 50%, 75%, and 100% ethanol, each wash being 10 mins at room temperature. 
- After the 100% ethanol wash, add 70% ethanol to the tubes and store at 4°C. 

### Timing

Daniella and I did spawning around 11:15am on Tuesday (11/11/25). It took me about an hour to dejelly the eggs and put them in the petri dish with the sperm water for fertilization. I put the eggs in the sperm water at 12:30pm. Fertilization usually takes about 30 mins so I put them in the 25°C incubator at 1pm. Based on the stages above at 25°C, collections times will be: 

- Blastula: 5-7pm on 11/11/25
	- Collection notes: I have two petri dishes in the incubator - one looks like it was fertilized well, the other looks like low fertilization overall. Keeping them both in the incubator for now. Fixed ~50-100 embryos in a tube (labelled 1) at 5:54pm. 
- Gastrula: 7am on 11/12/25
	- Collection notes: tired. Fixed ~50-100 embryos in a tube (labelled 2) at 7:20am.
- Planula: 1pm on 11/13/25
	- Collection notes: Fixed ~50-100 larvae in a tube (labelled 3) at 1:50pm. 
- Early juvenile: 1pm on 11/16/25
